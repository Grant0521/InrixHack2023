# InrixHack2023
Inrix Hack 2023 was a 24 hr hackathon on 11/12/2023. My team developed a website to develop unique, safe route around a user to practice driving. This was my first hackathon, so I mainly operated as a backend project manager by planning backend algorithms, functions, and API calls with some python contributions. This was my first python project.
